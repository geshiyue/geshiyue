    <h1>Overall Reflection</h1>
    <p>
      Taking the UHPS 6013 course has significantly broadened my understanding of leadership, especially transformational leadership. I learned that transformational leadership refers to a style where leaders inspire, motivate, and bring positive change to both individuals and organizations. This type of leadership goes beyond routine supervisionâ€”it focuses on vision, empowerment, and innovation. Through class discussions and activities, I gained insight into key transformational models and dimensions, such as idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. These dimensions helped me understand how transformational leaders build trust, encourage creativity, and foster personal growth in their teams.

   Moreover, I reflected deeply on the strengths and weaknesses of transformational leadership. One of its main strengths is the ability to inspire long-term commitment and drive innovation. However, I also realized it may lack effectiveness in short-term, task-oriented situations or when followers require more direct instructions. Studying world transformational leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Angela Merkel gave me real-life examples of how this leadership style works in different cultural and political contexts. Overall, this course not only equipped me with theoretical knowledge but also encouraged me to reflect on my own leadership potential and how I can apply these principles in my future career.
